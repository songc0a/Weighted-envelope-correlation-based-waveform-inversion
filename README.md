**This repository reproduces the results of the accepted paper "Weighted Envelope Correlation-based Waveform Inversion Using Automatic Differentiation" by IEEE TGRS. 

# Overview
We applied automatic differentiation under the framework of deepwave to complete FWI using different forms of objective functions.
